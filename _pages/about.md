I am Chi Han (韩迟), an incoming Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science to UIUC, to be supervised by Prof. Heng Ji.
My research interest resides in how language is organized, perceived, and understood, and more generally how these applies to the tasks of NLP.

My undergraduate years were spent at Yao Class in Tsinghua University from 2016 to 2020.
I also interned at [CocoSci Group](https://cocosci.mit.edu/) in 2019
working with Prof. [Joshua Tenenbaum](https://cocosci.mit.edu/josh) and Prof. [Jiajun Wu](https://jiajunwu.com/),
and at [ByteDance AI Lab](https://ailab.bytedance.com/) from 2020 to 2021 working with Prof. [Lei Li](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lilei/).
