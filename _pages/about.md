I am Chi Han (韩迟), currently a senior undergraduate student in Yao Class, IIIS Tsinghua University.
My research interest mainly lies in the intersection of Machine Learning and Cognitive Sciences.

In 2019, I spent time in [CoCoSci Group](http://cocosci.mit.edu), where I was supervised by [Prof. Joshua B. Tenenbaum](https://web.mit.edu/cocosci/josh.html).
Before that, I worked in MIG group at Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Prof. Chongjie Zhang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhang/).
